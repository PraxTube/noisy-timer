# Noisy Timer

This application is supposed to be a simple timer in the command line with some audio feedback (that's why noisy).

## TODO

The following points are meant as a general guide line. You will have to figure out the exact steps to take to achieve them.

- [ ] First create a very simple script that will just display a bar in the terminal and that will fill up every second until it is full (60 seconds) and then the program finishes (terminates)
- [ ] Now implement it so that there is a ding sound at the last 3 seconds before the timer finishes
- [ ] Add user input to the script that allows to specify the duration of the timer (not sure how exaclty to do this, as an argument or through I/O in the script?)

There are probably a few tweaks and adjustements that will happen towards the end but this will be a solid foundation. I would suggest you get your hand dirty as soon as possible, that's at least how I learned the most. Also it doesn't have to be perfect right away, and if you are stuck on something feel free to ask.
